# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game repository! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid with X and O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Game Explanation

### Objective

The objective of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be the first player to get three of your marks (either X or O) in a row. The row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.

### How to Play

1. **Game Start**: The game starts with an empty 3×3 grid.
2. **Player Turns**: Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the grid. Player 1 typically uses X and Player 2 uses O.
3. **Marking the Grid**: To place a mark, the player clicks on an empty cell in the grid.
4. **Winning the Game**: The game continues until one player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or all cells are filled.
5. **Draw**: If all 9 cells are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game is a draw.
6. **Restarting the Game**: After a win or a draw, players can restart the game to play again.

### Game Rules

- Players cannot place their mark on a cell that is already occupied.
- The game ends as soon as there is a winner or the grid is full.
- The first player to align three of their marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game.

## Features

- **Two-player game**: Play with a friend on the same device.
- **Simple UI**: Easy-to-use interface with a clear display of the game board.
- **Win detection**: Automatically detects and announces the winner or if the game is a draw.
- **Restart game**: Option to restart the game after it ends.
